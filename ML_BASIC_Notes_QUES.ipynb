        "Hi,  my name is Akashpati Mishra. I had done B.tech in Mechanical engineering. After graduating I joined my family business. We have a building material and sanitaryware wholesell shops. There i got a chance to learn about inventory management, customer handling. As I saw that growth in our business is saturate after a few time and I can utilise me to other field. from childhood I was intrested in stats and graph and I also want work in field which is growing with time and where i can involve in direct business decisions and I also want to be a part of new AI tools generation either then only seeting and using AI tools. so I was searching for field where i can utilize my intrest so came to know about data science. first I started learning by myself learnt python then after 2 moths learning by my own I soon realized that to grasp fast a proper guidance is required so I joined Almabetter as a trainee and from past 1 year I had learnt a lot of skills and also i had done few real time projects to get practical experience. Firstly I learnt Python and its few libraries then I learnt SQl then I had done a small project on Python. After that I learnt some of visualisation tools like Seaborn, Tableau, PowerBi, after I learnt Machine learning and also I had done 3 projects on Machine Learning"

        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "**Logistic regression**is a statistical method used to analyze and model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. A binary dependent variable is a variable that takes on one of two possible values, such as \"yes\" or \"no,\" \"true\" or \"false,\" or \"success\" or \"failure.\" Logistic regression is used in a wide variety of applications, including medical research, marketing, and finance.\n",

        "PCA or Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower dimensional space. It does this by projecting the data onto a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. The principal components are sorted by their ability to explain the maximum variation in the data, with the first principal component accounting for the highest variability.\n",

The elbow method uses a graph of the number of clusters against the WCSS to identify an \"elbow\" or a sharp bend in the graph.

The SAR component is denoted by SAR(p, P, s), where p is the order of the autoregressive component, P is the order of the seasonal autoregressive component, and s is the seasonal period.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Seasonal Integrated (SI) component:** This component removes the seasonality from the data by differencing it at the seasonal lag. The SI component is denoted by SI(d, D, s), where d is the order of the non-seasonal differencing, D is the order of the seasonal differencing, and s is the seasonal period.\n",

As a result, the weights are updated very slowly, and the network may fail to learn.\n",
